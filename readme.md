# Dungeons & Data
Dungeons & Data is a project developed to make it simpler to manage all your Dungeons and Dragons Characters! Using a clear and simple GUI helps against your screen getting cluttered with all the different types of information your character sheet needs. Simply create your account and start storing.

Add a new character or select an existing one:
![Character Select](readme-images/character-select.png)

When creating a new character, fill out your details:
![Add New Character](readme-images/add-character.png)

After you're done with that, you can see an overview of your character and adjust anything you would like:
